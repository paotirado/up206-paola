### UP 206A Introduction to GIS
This course will analyze foundations of spatial data science and review the basics of programming with Python. 
#### Project Ideas
My research interest lie within transportation safety, mobility justice, and equity. For this course I would like to explore the relationships between historically redlinned neighborhoods and transportation safety, specifically for non-motorized modes of transportation users :skateboard::bike::man_with_probing_cane::woman_in_manual_wheelchair:	:walking: and vulnerable groups such as Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC), low-income, children/ youth, elderly, and immigrants, and disabled populations. 
#### Objectives
In the past two years I have become super interested in mapping, but not having a technical background has made the learning process quite challenging at times. For this course I hope to accomplish the following:
- Become more confortable programming with Python
- Learn more skills to conduct spatial analysis and mapping outside of ESRI.
